# add onhashchange handler so that when we edit the url to go to another song, it actually loads the new song when I press enter, without me having to reload the whole page with the reload button
# pitch is off relative to jsxm; check sign of finetune/relnote?
# sometimes lags, particularly noticeable in mysong66.xm
 # avoid using actx.currentTime and instead pass along the time it's supposed to be as a starting point
# mixes too loud and clips
# Chrome mysteriously only plays the first note (row?)
# effects used in my music:
 # portamento down (0x02) (mysong77.xm)
  > parameter is Î”freq in 16ths of a semitone (32nds of a tone?) per tick
  # something's wrong with this in ~/othersmusic/mod/fromdemos/chip.xm pattern 6
 # set note panning position (0x08) (mysong54.xm, mysong79.xm)
 # set song speed/BPM (0x0f) (mysong01c.xm, mysong70b.xm, stargate.xm)
 # arpeggio (0x00) (mysong00a.xm, I actually used this thinking it was the volume, I think)
# add row numbers to patterns
# scroll to and highlight pattern row currently playing
# allow loading new song without reloading the page
# fix clicks, very noticeable in mysong60.xm
 > BiquadFilterNode doesn't work, clicks are at all frequencies
# degenerate volume envelopes don't behave correctly (spooky00.xm instrument 6)
# more control over playing:
 # stop
 # loop
# add alternate input to fetch songs from a (CORS-enabled or local) URL
 # when there's a fragment ID after the xm-player.html URL, use it to fill that input, and automatically fetch
# render to wav/mp3/etc.
 - in a Data URI so user can save it
 - or just to get more accurate playback (but without scrolling the page because that would still be inaccurate and thus lose sync with the pre-rendered version)
# interpret effects in tooltips
 # include units whenever possible
  # figure out what vibrato/tremolo "speed" means
- reorganize so that:
 # reading is separate from displaying
 # displaying uses appendChild as opposed to innerHTML+= more often
 # Channels keep note/effect state instead of PlayingNotes
 # Channels are always present, but not always in a note-on state
 # note-on-ness states are: sustained, released but still playing, not playing
 ? Channels in a playing state always have the same AudioNode graph, just different parameters (in non-playing state this can be freed)
 ? process per-tick instead of per-row (or can this really be accomplished by scheduling parameter changes within each row? I think probably not because some per-tick effects might interact with each other)
- get rid of lag between patterns by propagating when/startTime between them
# panning envelopes
# envelope sustain/loop
# volume fadeout
# volume slide
# instrument vibrato
 # find a reference for how this works; the docs I have don't say

? all the remaining effects (prioritized by what I see used most in others' music)
# don't continue effect vibrato after effect command goes away (revert to instrument vibrato settings) (for both volume column and effect column)
# make volume column (but not effect column) vibrato leave pitch where it is when it ends, instead of reverting to main pitch (seems like a bug, but FT2 does it and MT replicates it)
= bugs
 ? something wrong with porta in HYPERMMX.XM pattern 41, 4th and 5th channels
  > might have something to do with Amiga frequency table
 - releasing a note with a looping envelope can cause stack overflow?!
  > thought I fixed this, guess I didn't... gateways{1,2}.xm do it
 - multiple bugs in charons-hornpipe.xm:
  X note off not working/not timed correctly (end of row instead of beginning?)
   > only in Firefox
   > and in jsxm to some extent?
   > this is bug 1171438 again, I think
  - extended portamento (3xx) causes notes not to even play (jsxm does this too?!)
   > jsxm also seems to bitcrush the whistle; FT2 does neither of these
   > in both Chrome and Firefox
   > maybe same root cause as HYPERMMX problem above?
   > fixed this in the song by not having an envelope on porta'd notes
  - sounds like the tempo changes (Fxx) in pattern 3 cause the whistle notes to be doubled somehow? suspect something to do with rescheduling notes not descheduling the old versions
   > only in Firefox?
   > I think this is the Fxx bug in the readme
  - volume slide down in volume column is too slow
   > volume slide (should) happens tick by tick; fine volume slide happens on one of the ticks in a row (the first), and regular volume slide happens on all the other ticks (same whether in volume column or effect column)
   > anyway the rate is such that at speed/tempo 1, nothing happens, at speed 2 it's in 64ths of max volume per *row*, and at speed 3 it's twice what it was at speed 2, etc.
   > panning slide and global volume slide work similarly
