- process per-tick instead of per-row
 > "fine" versions of things do it on the first tick of a row, regular versions do it on all but the first tick of a row, all at the same rate during a tick
 > e.g. volume slide is in 64ths of max volume per tick, fine volume slide is effectively that per row, and regular volume slide is effectively that*(songspeed-1) per row
 - make Channel#applyCommand apply for a specific tick within a row
 - make Channel#triggerEnvelope schedule a *tick* at a time (not a row at a time as the comment suggests)
 - make a XM#playTick instead of XM#playRow
  . make playRow more like playPattern and playSong
  . do a simpler loop assuming we won't stop or jump in the middle of a row
 - include info on which ticks things happen on in note-tooltips.js
- test portamento effects
 - get speed right (think it's slightly too fast?)
- test EDx note delay effect
 - fix it if that's what's breaking inauglam pattern 15 chords
- test Fxx tempo change effect
 - fix it if that's what's causing note doubling in charons-hornpipe from pattern 3 on
  > only happens in Firefox live playing
? test and implement all the remaining effects (prioritized by what I see used most in others' music)
? reorganize so that Channels in a playing state always have the same AudioNode graph, just different parameters (in non-playing state this can be freed)
? something wrong with porta in HYPERMMX.XM pattern 41, 4th and 5th channels
 > might have something to do with Amiga frequency table (not sure why I thought that originally, but I'll keep this note here just in case...)
